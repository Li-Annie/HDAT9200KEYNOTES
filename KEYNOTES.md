#### Epidemiological Triad

- Agent
- Host
- Environment

Epidemiology: Study of disease - Involves the interaction of the agent
and the host in an environment that supports transmission of disease
from the source to the host.

#### Epidemiology terminology

Risk factor: variable that is associated with the outcome Exposure:
could be interpreted as causation, the factor that leads to the outcome
Outcome: the measurement of interest Extraneous variables: variables
which are associated with the outcome, but are not of particular
interest to the investigation Confounder: factors which influence both
the exposure and outcome

#### Goal of investigations

- To test a hypothesis to see whether the exposure has an effect on the
  outcome.
  - To ensure that the findings are valid
    - Need to ensure that the sample is representative of the population
      - there must be a control/comparison group which is not exposed
        and a treatment group which is exposed
      - The allocation of participants needs to be randomised, i.e. have
        equal probability of being allocated to each group
        - This prevents selection bias and removes systematic effects
          due to confounding
      - Blinding where one or more parties are not aware of whether
        placebo or treatment were provided to each patient ensuring that
        the results are not influenced by assessment bias
      - Matching whereby participants are between the two groups are
        balanced in the confounding factors
        - Both the control and treatment group need to exhibit similar
          characteristics to eliminate systematic differences due to
          sampling methods or confounding effects
    - Both the control and treatment group needs to be measured across
      the same length of time

#### Types of randomisation

1.  Simple randomisation: like tossing a coin
2.  Block randomisation: split into blocks
3.  Stratified randomisation: group allocation within the same variable,
    i.e. age group
4.  Minimisation: Using algorithm for allocation
5.  Cluster allocation: group allocation, i.e. patient attending same
    LHD

#### Bias

- Distortion of the estimated effects caused by a systematic difference
  between the groups being compared.

Reducing Bias - Improve the design of the experiment - Ensure the groups
are comparable in characteristics in both control and treatment group -
Adjust for confounders

#### Type of Bias

- Selection Bias: Participants do not have an equal chance to be
  allocated to the control or treatment group resulting in the groups
  not being representative of the sample population.
  - Results could be exaggeration of estimated effects
  - Are not always avoidable depending on the study design and funding
    i.e survey
- Non-response bias: participants might not be inclined to respond to
  certain questions resulting in over-representation in one study group
  over the other.
- Loss of follow-up: paricipants could be lost due to deaths, relocation
  or other reasons.
- Recall/responder bias: responses are likely to support a positive
  outcome, i.e. participants unlikely to report smoking in pregnancy
- Interviewer/observer bias: the investigators are more likely to look
  for associations between the exposure and outcome if they are aware of
  which group is the treatment group and which group is the control
  group.
- Surveillance: Similar to interviewer bias, the treatment group may be
  under more rigorous monitoring than the control group

#### Other Causes of Unavoidable Misclassification of Findings

- Random sampling error: when sample statistics differ from
  corresponding population parameter
- Differential misclassification: measurement error is different in
  control and treatment group resulting in under or over estimation of
  effects
- Non-differential misclassiation: measurement error is the same in both
  groups, but always skewed towards the null hypothesis. The greater the
  error, the greater the bias towards the null.
